Bovik had the vision to make all banking transactions electronic way back in the 1980&rsquo;s, before the web came into existence. His first business, Long Range Transactions, was acquired by Manufacturer&rsquo;s Hanover in 1990, and he dedicated the proceeds to making CFS a reality. After many difficult years, Dr. Bovik made eBanking really work. Now CFS is proud to be the premier pure eBank!</p>
